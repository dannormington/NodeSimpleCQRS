Node CQRS
==============

CQRS pattern implemented using node. The example code includes both a base set of classes as well as a sample domain model, events, and set of endpoints to interact.

This implemenatation is inspired by Greg Young's Simple CQRS C# example

Note
====
- The purpose of the repo was to learn some node.js while applying patterns I enjoy working with. I'm sure there are several areas that experienced node.js developers would choose to implement differently. I welcome comments and suggestions.
